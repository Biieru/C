# C Learning Repository on the first period at SENAC

## Introduction
Welcome to my C Learning Repository! 
This section is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn the C programming language. 
Here, you'll find a collection of codes, algorithms, and exercises that I've worked on as part of my learning process.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to track my progress, showcase my understanding of C programming concepts, and serve as a resource for fellow learners who may benefit from studying or reviewing these examples.

## Contents
- **Basic Programs:** Simple C programs covering fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, operators, and control structures.
- **Algorithms:** Implementation of various algorithms and data structures in C, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, linked lists, and more.
- **Exercises:** Practice exercises and coding challenges to reinforce learning and problem-solving skills.

## Why C?
**The notebook**: C is a powerful and widely used programming language known for its efficiency, flexibility, and close-to-the-machine capabilities. By mastering C, I aim to build a strong foundation in programming that will serve as a stepping stone for exploring other languages and domains.
**My Opinion:** Because I had to learn, somebody save me please.

## Contributions
If you find any errors, have suggestions for improvement, or would like to contribute additional examples or explanations, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. I welcome collaboration and feedback from the community to make this repository a valuable resource for learners of C programming.

Thank you for exploring my C Learning Repository!
